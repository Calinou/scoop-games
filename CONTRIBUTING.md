# Contributing to scoop-games

Thank you for your interest in scoop-games! Before contributing,
be sure to know about these few guidelines:

- New packages are welcome, but keep in mind this repository is intended
  to contain *games* and *game-related tools*.
  - By "game-related tools", we mean tools that are specific to a game
    or a game series (such as a map editor or modding tool).
  - Generic utilities related to gaming (such as Steam or GOG-related utilities)
    should be added to [Extras](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Extras)
    instead, as they tend to appeal to a wider audience compared to this bucket.
- See the official [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/.github/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
